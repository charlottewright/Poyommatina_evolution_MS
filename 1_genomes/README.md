# Section 1: Genomes for 27 species of Polyommatina

[phylogeny]
Contains the data needed to plot the phylogeny annotated with histograms of haploid chromosome numbers, genome size and repeat density per genome shown in Figure 1.

[satellites]
Contains the data needed to plot the percentage of each genome occupied by satellites shown in Supplementary Figure 3.
