# Section 8: Fissions occur at the midpoint of long chromosomes

[polyommatina_lengths](<https://github.com/charlottewright/Poyommatina_evolution_MS/tree/main/8_midpoint/polyommatina_lengths>)

Data needed to plot chromosome length variation across Polyommatina as shown in Figure 6A.

[simulated_variation](<https://github.com/charlottewright/Poyommatina_evolution_MS/tree/main/8_midpoint/simulated_variation>)

Script needed to simulate fissions under a model of random fission with a minimum chromosome size and data needed to compare observed variation in chromosome lengths to simulated variation in fission, as shown in the histograms of Figure 6B.

[fission_length](<https://github.com/charlottewright/Poyommatina_evolution_MS/tree/main/8_midpoint/fission_lengths>)

Data and code needed to plot number of fissions derived from each ancestral chromosome, for each species of Lysandra, as shown in Figures 6D, 6E and 6F.
